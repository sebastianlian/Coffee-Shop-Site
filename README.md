Mugs & Muggles Cafe - Final Project Web Development

GOAL
----------------
This project utilizes PHP and MySQL for back-end development, and HTML, CSS (Materialize) for front-end development
to create a coffee shop's website. The website allows the user to add, display and remove records from the database.

USAGE
----------------
To place an order, the user must enter their login credentials. If the user does not have login credentials they must
click on 'Sign Up Now!' to register.

The users login credentials are stored in the MySQL database under the users table in form of a hashed password for
security purposes.

Upon successful login, the user is brought to the homepage. There the user can see a 'Login' and 'Logout' button in the header,
and a navigation menu with three tabs: Home, View Orders, and About. Additionally, the user can make their selection of
brew, size of the brew, and enter the quantity. For user convenience, a table of prices is located below the order submission form.

When the order is submitted, an 'Order Confirmation Details' page displays the details of the order the user just placed.
From here, the user can choose to navigate Home, View Orders, About, or choose to Log Out.

UPCOMING
-------------
Reset password feature is currently not working.
